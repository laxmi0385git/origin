ABP-WU:
-Elisa Rushing shows in O365 but not OnPremABPCFS:
-Brian Sheer

>CASHAPP:
Carrie
hang on, i hit enter to fast
Elisa Rushing needs to be in ABP-WU
Brian Sheer needs to be in ABPCFS
Carrie Bender needs to be in CASHAPP
Angela J Allgyer was adding them through Outlook, it appears. Is that incorrect? The changes didn't appear to have synced across OnPrem to O365. also, when I manually updated Carrie to the CASHAPP group, she still didn't get any emails sent to that group
